# Web_Control
Quick and dirty web gui used to control the game servers. Game and Apache are run on the same server, for now.

#To add
Add delete/replace option for files.

Organize code so it's more uniform and compatible to be put anywhere in a template (almost done)

Use javascript to ajax stream everything! Better updates to push to multiple admins/mods online.

Create archive option for files.

Allow selecting which file to start the server with (manual override of load-latest)

Add zip/tmp dir checker to ensure chat function is inside the scenario, or else, send messages as "server"

Better version control to update factorio/purge old factorio instances. (could just do an update, which a python git already exists for, but want more flexability for downgrades in the event an experimental version is badly bugged.)

production reports and a public front end for player viewing. Even if we tie this front end into our main godaddy page for better control and display.
