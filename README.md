# Web_Control
Quick and dirty web gui used to control the game servers. Game and Apache are run on the same server, for now.

# Installation
(Realized this was kind of important... so we're working on it)

Ubuntu 16.06 (or any other linux of your choosing, if you have the know-how to figure it out

Apache2

php7

# In Development
Add delete/replace option for files. (almost done)

Organize code so it's more uniform and compatible to be put anywhere in a template (almost done)

Verify player-data.json

Verify config.ini

Create archive option for save files.

Better version control to update factorio/purge old factorio instances. (could just do an update, which a python git already exists for, but want more flexability for downgrades in the event an experimental version is badly bugged.)

MapGen and git-linking

Allow selecting which file to start the server with (manual override of load-latest)

Use javascript to ajax stream everything! Better updates to push to multiple admins/mods online.

Syncronized server banning.

production reports and a public front end for player viewing. Even if we tie this front end into our main godaddy page for better control and display.
