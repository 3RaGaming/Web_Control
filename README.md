# Web_Control
Quick and dirty web gui used to control the game servers. Game and Apache are run on the same server, for now.

# Installation
(Realized this was kind of important... so we're working on it)

Ubuntu 16.06 (or any other linux of your choosing, if you have the know-how to figure it out

Apache2

php7

# In Development
Organize code so it's more uniform and compatible to be put anywhere in a template (almost done. This will be the last feature update to this version of the master)

We are in development of Discord bot integreation to factorio. A new repo will handle the discord bot itself, and a new branch in this repo (dev-bot) will handle the integration of Discord bot to the Web Control. Since this master version of web control work's as is, it will remain for others to use. Once dev-bot can handle being used with or without the discord bot, then this master will be replaced. Bug-fixes will still be applied to this master, but new features will be implemente only to 'dev' and 'dev-bot'. Consider 'dev-bot' as the "unstable" master version of Web_Control
